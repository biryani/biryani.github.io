I am a [CNLS](https://cnls.lanl.gov) Post-Doc at the Theoretical Division of the [Los Alamos National Lab](https://www.lanl.gov). My research  lies at the intersection of Quantum Information, Machine Learning and Statistical Physics. Before Los Alamos, I did my Ph.D. focusing on quantum algorithms and M.Tech  in computational science from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/) working under [Prof. Apoorva Patel](https://chep.iisc.ac.in/Personnel/adpatel.html).
