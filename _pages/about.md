I am a Scientist at the Theoretical Division of [Los Alamos National Lab](https://www.lanl.gov), working on problems at the intersection of Quantum Information, Machine Learning, and Statistical Physics. I was previously a [CNLS](https://cnls.lanl.gov) Postdoctoral Fellow in the same division mentored by [Dr. Andrey Lokhov](http://www.lptms.universite-paris-saclay.fr/andrey-lokhov/) and [Dr. Marc Vuffray](https://www.vuffray.com). Before Los Alamos, I did my Ph.D. focusing on quantum algorithms and M.Tech in computational science from the Indian Institute of Science, working under [Prof. Apoorva Patel](https://chep.iisc.ac.in/Personnel/adpatel.html).
